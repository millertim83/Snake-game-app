# Snake Game
This is my fifth project for the Software Development Mastermind program. To complete this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Deliverables:

Snake game ends when:
Snake touches itself
Snake touches the outside border

When the game ends, the gameplay should stop and the user should be notified that the game is over
The snake should grow one length whenever it eats the apple
The apple should randomly place itself on the board after snake consumes the apple
The snake should be controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard
The game will  show a score of how many apples have been eaten
